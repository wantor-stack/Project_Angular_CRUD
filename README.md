## Frontend


This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.3.3.

### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

### Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

### Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.

## Backend


### JSON Server [![Node.js CI](https://github.com/typicode/json-server/actions/workflows/node.js.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/typicode/json-server/actions/workflows/node.js.yml)

Get a full fake REST API with __zero coding__ in __less than 30 seconds__ (seriously)

In a normal enterprise application, you work with many teams and third-party APIs. Imagine you need to call a third-party Restful web service that gives you JSON data to process. You are on a tight schedule, so you can not wait for the service to finish its work and then start doing your own. If you want to have a mockup Rest Web service in place to get the demo data for you, then json-server is the tool you are looking for.

* [JSONPlaceholder - Live running version](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com)

    { "id": 1, "body": "some comment", "postId": 1 }
